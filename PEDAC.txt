Once the program starts, you should display a greeting to the user describing the challenge.
Ask the user to think of a number between 1 and 1024.
Do NOT prompt the user for their number. Your program will guess the number IN THEIR MIND
Prompt the user with your guess and allow them to tell you if their number is higher, lower, or correct.
Keep refining your guess until you have the correct answer.
Use methods to organize your code. Here are some suggestions for methods you might use:
ShowGreeting
ComputeNewLowIfTooLow
ComputeNewHighIfTooHigh
BragWhenCorrect
Use at least one or two methods

Problem:
There should be a greeting, and then the console should
display a question, asking for a number within range 1 to 1024. 
No user input is needed here. The program should guess a number
and then ask if the guess is higher or lower than the user's number.
If the answer is higher, the lower limit of the next guess should be
1 above on the next guess. If the answer is lower, the upper limit
of the next guess should be 1 less. The guesses should divide the
available range in half to quickly zero in on the user's guess.
If the answer is correct, the program should congratulate itself.

Examples:
range 1-3, user number is 3. Program guesses 2, user says higher
program guesses 3, uses says correct

range 1-1024, user number is 1. Program guesses 512, uses says lower
program guesses 256, user says lower
program guesses 128, user says lower
program guesses 64, user says lower
program guesses 32, user says lower
program guesses 16, user says lower
program guesses 8, user says lower
program guesses 4, user says lower
program guesses 2, user says lower
programs guesses 1, user says correct

Data Structures:
looping the guessing
upper guess range
lower guess range
user input of higher, lower, correct

Algorithm:
1. Display a greeting
2. Ask the user to think of a number between 1(lower limit) and
   1024(upper limit)
3. Begin guessing at (upper limit + lower limit + 1)/2 = 512
4. If user input is higher, the new lower limit is + 1 
5. If user input is lower, the new upper limit is -1 
6. Continue shrinking the ranges of program guesses in this way
  until a correct answer is guessed.
